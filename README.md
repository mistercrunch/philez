# NPC - Northern Phun Co.

A tribute site preserving **Northern Phun Co.**, Quebec's bilingual underground e-zine from the 418 area code (1992-1994).

## Goals

- Make these old fanzines easier to read and consume on the modern web
- Get the content indexed by search engines for discoverability
- Convert the funky CP437 DOS encoding to proper UTF-8 (preserving ASCII art)
- Make the content searchable using Nextra's built-in search

## About NPC
