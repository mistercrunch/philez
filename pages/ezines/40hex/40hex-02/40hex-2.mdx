             - how to get infected files into lame bbs'S -



oK, ONE PROBLEM WITH SENDING INFECTED FILES TO bbs'S IS THAT YOU NEVER

CAN TELL IF THEY WILL BE DETECTED BY scan.  oR IF YOU ARE SENDING BOMBS

THE SYSOP MIGHT USE chk4bomb TO DETECT CODE THAT IS DATA DAMAGING.


i'M GONNA TELL YOU HOW TO GET AROUND THIS, WHAT YOU NEED IS THE FOLLOWING-


                            pklite OR lzexe

                                   AND

                           a GOOD HEX EDITOR


wHAT YOU DO IS THIS, COMPRESS THE INFECTED FILE WITH pKLITE OR lZEXE.  tHIS

WILL MAKE CHANGE THE FILES CHECKSUM AND id STRINGS QUITE A BIT SO IT CAN'T

BE DETECTED BY scan AND DAMAGING DATA WILL NOT BE FOUND BY chk4bomb.  tHE

PROBLEM IS THAT NOW THE SYSOP CAN USE chk4lite TO DETECT IS THE FILE IS

INDEED INFECTED.   sO WHAT YOU DO IS THIS --


lOAD UP THE HEX EDITIOR -


nOW LOOK AT THE FILE, IT WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF YOU COMPRESSED IT

WITH pklite.

yOU SEE THE HEADER?  wELL WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS OVERWRITE THE HEADER WITH

GARBAGE.  dON'T WRITE TEXT CAUSE THAT IS TO DECTECTABLE BY A DUMP PROGRAM.

jUST OVERWRITE THE PART THAT SAYS "pklite CORP....rESERVED" WITH HEX BYTES.

aLSO DISTROY THE PART OF THE CODE THAT SAYS "nOT ENOUGH MEMORY", DONT KILL

THE "$" SYMBOL.

tHIS WILL MAKE THE COMPRESSED FILE-


a> uNDETECTABLE TO VIRUS SCANNERS, AND chk4bomb TYPE PROGRAMS

b> uN-dECOMPRESSABLE

c> chk4lite WONT NOTICE IT AS A pklite FILE


iT'S THAT EASY!


kEEP IN MIND HOWEVER THAN ANY FILE THAT THE VIRUS INFECTS WILL NO LONGER

BE ENCRYPTED BY pklite, SO THIS METHOD IS GOOD ONLY ON GETTING YOUR VIRUS

INTO THE FRONT DOOR.


sEE THE ARTICLE IN ISSUE ONE ON MAKING NEW VIRUS STRAINS.



                            fORENOTE


     aFTER WRITING THIS ARTICLE scan vERSION 80 CAME OUT, iT NOW HAS THE

     ABILITY TO SCAN INTO pKLITE COMPRESSED FILES.  jUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT

     THIS TEQNIQUE STILL WORKS AND scan CANNOT DETECT THE FILE AS BEING

     COMPRESSED AS pklite.

               the safe way to experiment with viruses



 tHE PROBLEM WITH FOOLING AROUND WITH VIRUSES IS THAT YOU NEVER KNOW

 WHAT DAMAGE THERE GOING TO DO TO YOUR HARD DISK.  i HAVE A COUPLE OF

 SO CALLED VIRUSES THAT WHEN RUN, AUTOMATICALLY SCREW UP THE fat ON

 ALL THE DISKS IN THE SYSTEM.  wELL, THERES A WAY AROUND GETTING THE

 SHAFT FROM THESE PROGRAMS, AND ALSO TO EXPERIMENT WITH LEGITAMENT

 VIRUSES.


 tHE KEY IS THE dos UTITLITY subst, MAKE THIS BATCH FILE, AND COPY IT

 TO A FLOPPY.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 @ECHO OFF
SUBST D: A:\

 SUBST C: A:\

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  wHAT THIS WILL DO IS SEND ANY ACCESS TO DISKS c: AND d: (THE TWO

  HARD DISKS IN MY CASE) TO DRIVE a:  sO THE ONLY DAMAGE INFLICTED

  WILL BE TO THE FLOPPY IN a:


  nO PROGRAMS CAN ACCESS YOU HARD DISK WHEN THIS COMMAND IS ISSUED.  i

  USE IT ALL THE TIME AND AS OF NOW IT HAS PROVED 100% SAFE.


  oH YEAH, IF YOU DONT FEEL LIKE DISTROYING A FLOPPY EVERY TIME YOU

  MESS WITH A VIRUS, YOU CAN DO THIS TEQNIQUE FROM A ram DISK.


  hAVE FUN...

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


oNE OF THE QUESTIONS WHILE WRITING YOUR VIRUS IS HOW QUICKLY YOU WANT IT

TO SPREAD.  tHE EASY ANSWER IS "aS FAST AS POSSIBLE" BUT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE

BEST ANSWER.  iF A VIRUS MOVES SLOWLY, IT WILL TAKE MUCH LONGER BEFORE SOMEBODY

NOTICES HARD DRIVE SPACE DISAPPEARING, HE/SHE WILL NOTICE FEWER CHANGES TO THE

FILE DATES,AND ALL OTHER SYMPTOMS WILL BE LESSENED.  hOWEVER, THIS DOES PROVIDE

LONGER FOR ANTI-VIRUS PEOPLE (PRONOUNCED sCUM, WITH A CAPITAL s) TO DISCOVER THE

VIRUS.  tHIS ISSUE TIES DIRECTLY INTO THE ISSUE OF ACTIVATION, SHORT OR LONG.

sINCE THE ISSUES ARE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL, i WILL COVER BOTH TOGETHER, BECAUSE

THEY ARE SO CLOSELY TIED.


                        tHE cASE fOR fAST

                        =================


    vIRI SHOULD SPREAD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  tHIS ALLOWS AS LITTLE TIME

AS POSSIBLE FOR THE MAKERS OF ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS TO COME UP WITH AN ANTIDOTE

BEFORE THE VIRUS IS WIDELY SPREAD.  tHIS SHOULD BE TIED WITH A SHORT ACTIVATION

PERIOD TO CAUSE AS MANY PROBLEMS AS POSSIBLE BEFORE DETECTION IS POSSIBLE.

bECAUSE FEWER COPIES ARE GENERATED BEFORE ACTIVATION, EACH COPY MAY BE LARGER.

tHIS ALLOWS FOR MORE EXTENSIVE ANTI-ANTI-VIRAL TACTICS, WHICH ARE BECOMING

INCREASINGLY MORE IMPORTANT AS THE NUMBER OF ANTI-VIRAL PRODUCTS RISES.  jUST

REMEMBER, MOST OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE SHIT. sO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH.


                        tHE cASE fOR sLOW

                        =================


   vIRI SHOULD SPREAD SLOWLY, BECAUSE THIS IS LESS OBTRUSIVE, AND THEREFORE

USERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO NOTICE A CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM.  tHIS SHOULD BE COUPLED

WITH A LONG ACTIVATION PERIOD AS TO HAVE MAXIMUM PENETRATION BEFORE THE VIRUS

ACTIVATES.  a SLOW-SPREADING VIRUS WILL CIRCULATE TO MORE VIRUS PROGRAMMERS WHO

WILL BE ABLE TO MODIFY THE PROGRAM FOR SPECIFIC NEEDS OR TO ADAPT TO ANTIVIRAL

TACTICS.  oN A PURELY ACADEMIC NOTE, SLOW SPREADING VIRI MUST BE SMALLER, AS

MORE COPIES MUST BE GENERATED.  tHIS MEANS THAT VIRI MUST BE PROGRAMMED BETTER,

WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE GENERAL COMMUNITY.


                        tHE cASE aGAINST fAST

                        =====================


     fAST SPREADING OF VIRI IS LIKELY TO DRAW ATTENTION.  oNCE A VIRUS HAS

BEEN CAUGHT, IN MOST OF THE CASES, IT IS DEAD AND USELESS.  a VIRUS SHOULD

INFECT THE GREATEST AREA IN THE SHORTEST TIME BEFORE THE ANTI-VIRUS PEOPLE

INEVITABLY CATCH UP TO THE VIRUS.  hOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE NECESSITY OF A SHORT

ACTIVATION TIME, THIS VIRUS HAS A LESSER RANGE THAN A SLOW-SPREADING VIRUS.  tHE

PROGRAMMER MUST RELY ON EITHER (A) THE QUICK DISTRIBUTION OF THE VIRUS ALONG AT

LEAST A REGIONAL LEVEL --OR-- (B) THE ABILITY OF OTHER VIRUS PROGRAMMERS TO

OBTAIN AND MODIFY EITHER THE SOURCE CODE OR DISSASSEMBLE AND MODIFY THE

DISTRIBUTED VIRUS.  iF POSSIBLE, THE SOURCE SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED ALONG TRUSTED

CHANNELS.  tHERE SHOULD BE AS LITTLE CHANCE AS POSSIBLE OF AN ANTIVIRAL

RESEARCHER OBTAINING A COPY OF THE SOURSE FOR YOUR MASTERPIECE.


                        tHE cASE aGAINST sLOW

                        =====================


        a SLOW SPREADING VIRUS IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GET CAUGHT BY ANTIVIRAL

PEOPLE PRIOR TO ITS NECESSARILY LONG PRE-ACTIVATION PERIOD.  tHERE WILL BE MORE

DEFENSES OUT AGAINST THE VIRUS BEFORE IT HAS SPREAD MUCH.  hOWEVER, IF THE VIRUS

IS WELL-DONE, IT WILL HAVE SPREAD FAR BEFORE IT IS CAUGHT.


                        cONCLUSION

                        ==========


    aCTUALLY, i LIED.  tHERE IS NO CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN FROM THIS, AS THIS

IS IN ITSELF THE CONCLUSION OF LONG HOURS OF THOUGHT AND MUCH BRAINSTORMING ON

bbsS.  iF YOU WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT, i CAN BE REACHED ON lANDfILL bbs, PHONE

NUMBER ABOVE.  iN A FUTURE ARTICLE, i WILL ATTEMPT TO COVER ANTI-ANTI-VIRUS

TACTICS.  i MAY ALSO RESPOND TO SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS/COMMENTS i MAY RECIEVE.

        tHIS INTERVIEW WAS 

            sQUARE pARK, mANHATTEN.


hr:  sO WHAT GOT YOU STARTED IN THE VIRUS BUSINESS?


sss: wELL, i USED TO WRITE GRAFFITI ALL OVER AND THAT GOT SORT OF

    PLAYED OUT, SO i NEEDED SOMETHING ELSE DISTRUCTIVE TO DO.  sO

    I STARTED GETTING INTO COMPUTERS, THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW

    i'M WRITING VIRUSES.


hr:  wHAT WAS YOU FIRST EXPERENCE WITH VIRUSES?


sss: wELL THE FIRST TIME i HEARD OF THEM WAS WHEN THAT DICKHEAD GOT

     ARRESTED FOR PUTTING THE WORM...


hr:  yOU MEAN mORRIS?


sss: yEAH THAT ASSHOLE, IT WAS ON THE NEWS AND ALL THAT - SO i GOT

     TO THINKING, THAT WOULD BE A COOL THING TO DO.


hr:  wHAT WAS THE FIRST VIRUS YOU RAN ACROSS?


sss: hA... sOME DICK GAVE ME A COPY OF (PAUSE) IT THINK IT WAS

     nORTON 4.0 WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.  sO i TOOK IT HOME AND PUT

     IT ON MY HARD DRIVE.  tHE NEXT THING YOU KNOW ALL THIS WEIRD

     SHIT STARTS GOING ON.  lIKE PROGRAMS WON'T RUN AND THIS LITTLE

     BOX OPENS UP ON THE BOTTOM OF MY SCREEN ALL OF A SUDDEN.  sO i

     GET A COPY OF scan, THEN i FIND OUT ALMOST ALL MY FILES ARE

     INFECTED WITH jERUSALEM.


hr:  wHAT DID YOU DO?


sss: wELL i RE-FORMATTED THE DRIVE AND EXAMINED THE COPY OF jERU FOR

     MONTHS.  tHEN ONE DAY i USED A hEX EDITOR TO CHANGE THE SUmsdoS

     STRING TO skism-1.  tHEN i WENT TO ALL THE COMPUTERS i COULD

     FIND AND INFECTED THEM.  tHE NEXT THING YOU KNOW MY FRIEND

     SHOWS ME THIS LIST WITH MY NAME ON IT.  iT WAS pATTI hOFFMANS

     DOCUMENT.  sHIT, i THOUGHT i WAS THE MAN BACK THEN.


hr:  tHEN WHAT?


sss: tHEN - WELL i GOT INTO ASSEMBLER AND DISSASEMBLY AND i STARTED

     TO LEARN HOW TO MODIFY THE CODE AND ALL THAT.  tHE NEXT THING

     YOU KNOW i HAD MADE MY OWN VIRUS FROM THE SCRAPS OF jERU.


hr:  cAPTIAN tRIPS, RIGHT?


sss: yEAH, SORT OF.  tHEN SOMEONE i KNOW SENT IT TO ALL THE BOARDS

     IN TOWN UNDER A TROJAN NAME AND FUCKED A LOT OF PEOPLES SHIT

     UP.  oH WELL.  tHEN i GUESS i GREW OUT OF THE SCAVENGER MODE

     AND STARTED WRITTING MY OWN SHIT, FROM SCRATCH. 


hr:  lIKE WHAT?


sss: wELL THEY WERE ALL CALLED sKISM SO AND SO, LIKE sKISM 10, sKISM

     11 AND ALL THAT.  tHEN i MEET PEOPLE AND THEY STARTED HELPING

     ME OUT AND NOW WE GOT THIS THING GOING ON.


hr:  yOU MEAN sMART kIDS iNTO sICK mETHODS?


sss: yEAH, YOU KNOW ALL THID DID DID DAT.


hr:  hOW DO YOU NAME YOUR VIRUSES?


sss: wELL DEPENDS WHATS ON MY MIND.  sKISM WAS MY TAG FOR LIKE FOUR 

     YEARS, SO i THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL IF PEOPLE SAW MY NAME IN 

     THE NEWSPAPER AND ALL THAT.  i GOT cAPTIAN tRIPS AFTER READING 

     tHE sTAND, BY sTEPHEN kING.  1992 WAS JUST WHAT i NAMED IT CAUSE 

     THE VIRUS CAME OUT TO BE ABOUT 1945 BYTES SO i JUSY PADDED IT OUT

     TO NEXT YEARS DATE.  808 WAS NAMED AFTER THE tr-808, A 'DRUM

     MACHINE' USED IN HIP-HOP.


hr:  wHATS THE LATEST PROJECTS?


sss: yOU KNOW, YOU WROTE MOST OF THE SHIT.


hr:  tELL THEM.  tHE PEOPLE.


sss: wELL, WE DID skism 1992, WHICH WAS FUNNY, THEN A MEMBER OF

     skism, WHO SHALL BE NAMELESS MADE 808.  nOW i'M JUST TAKING A

     BREAK FROM VIRUSES AND COMPUTERS FOR THE SUMMER.


hr:  yOU STOPPED?


sss: yOUR CRAZY, NAH - iT'S GOT TO WAIT A WHILE, THEN i'LL GET BACK

     INTO IT - WHEN SCHOOL STARTS AGAIN.


hr:  wHAT DO YOU THINK OF mCaFFE?


sss: hE'S COOL, WHAT THE FUCK AM SUPPOSED TO SAY.  hE DOES A GOOD

     JOB AT SPREADING MY NAME AROUND.  i REALLY LIKE pAT hOFFMAN,

     THANKS FOR THE WRITE UPS.  yOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND - THESE PEOPLE

     MAKE US INTO INFAMOUS VILLIANS.  i CAN DEAL WITH THAT.


hr:  dO YOU MIND THEM DETECTING YOUR VIRUSES?


sss: nAH, FUCK IT - iF MY SHIT CAN MAKE IT FROM ny TO cALIFORNIA

     WITHOUT EFFORT, IT SHOWS IT WORKS.  tHATS IT.  tHERS A LOT MORE

     WHERE THAT CAME FROM.  oNE MORE THING, i HATE THAT GAY BITCH

     rOSS gREENBURG AUTHOR OF fLU-sHOT.  wHAT

     A DICK.  hE'S JUST AN ASSHOLE TRING TO SELL HIS SHIT PRODUCT.

     hE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH AND INSTEAD OF CRASHING HIS BOARD, i'D

     LIKE TO KICK HIS FUCKEN ASS.  wHERE'S HIS OFFICE?  uP ONE 57TH

     RIGHT?  lETS TAKE A WALK.  jUST KIDDIN' BUT THE GUYS PRODUCT

     SUCKS AND HE'S JUST A GREEDY ASSHOLE.  i'M GLAD i SENT A TROJAN

     VERSION OF HIS VIRUS SCANNER AROUND. hA YOU DICK!


hr:  wHAT VIRUS AUTHORS DO YOU LOOK UP TO?


sss: mYSELF - hA hA (LAUGHTER) hA hA.  nO, i LOVE wHALE - THAT WAS

     CLEVER.  i LIKE dARK aVENGER, THE REAL ONE.  iTS HARD TO BE

     ORIGINAL, AND THESE GUYS WERE.  hATS OFF YOU CRAZY FUCKIN'

     bULGARIAN mETAL-hEAD!


hr:  wHAT ABOUT GROUPS OF VIRUS WRITERS?


sss: i THINK WERE THE ONLY ONE.  oH YEAH AND THOSE rABID PEOPLE YOU

     TOLD ME ABOUT, YEAH THERE JUST LIKE US - PEOPLE TRING TO MAKE

     THERE MARK IN THE WORLD, OR SHOULD i SAY DENT IN THE WORLD.

     gERMANS ARE BUGGING OUT TOO - sHIT, THEY WRITE HALF THE SHIT OUT

     THERE THESE DAYS.  mORE POWER TO THEM


hr:  wHAT IS YOUR ADVISE TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WRITE VIRUSES?


sss: gET A LATE PASS!  nO AS i SAID MORE POWER TO YOU. jUST REMEMBER

     YOU GOT TO HAVE STYLE AND LEARN TO BE original.


hr:  wHAT NEXT FROM YOU?


sss: i DON'T REALLY KNOW.  i'M WAITING TO HOOK UP A FEW MORE PEOPLE

     TO THE PACK, THEN WE'LL GET THE THING ROLLIN hard.  tILL THEN

     'a LITTLE AT A TIME...'

doctor /? FOR HELP


iT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO YOU TO KNOW THAT eDDIE (ALSO KNOWN AS "dARK

aVENGER") IS THE MOST WIDESPREAD VIRUS IN bULGARIA FOR THE TIME

BEING.  hOWEVER i HAVE INFORATION THAT eDDIE IS WELL KNOWN IN THE

usa, wEST gERMANY AND ussr TOO.


i STARTED IN WRITING THE VIRUS IN EARLY sEPTEMBER 1988. iN THOSE

TIMES THERE WERE NO ANY VIRUSES IN bULGARIA, SO i DECIDED TO WRITE

THE FIRST bULGARIAN VIRUS.  tHERE WERE SOME DIFFERENT eDDIE'S  VERSIONS:

version 1.1, 16-dec-1988


iN dECEMBER i'VE DECIDED TO ENHANCE THE VIRUS.  tHIS VERSION COULD

INFECT FILES DURING THEIR OPENING.  fOR THAT REASON, A READ BUFFER

WAS ALLOCATED IN HIGH END OF MEMORY, RATHER THAN USING dos FUNCTION

48H WHEN NEEDED.  tHE DISK WAS DESTROYED INSTEAD OF THE INFECTED FILES.

version 1.2, 19-dec-1988


tHIS ADDED A NEW FEATURE THAT CAUSES (FOR EXAMPLE) COMPILED PROGRAMS

TO BE INFECTED AT ONCE IF THE VIRUS IS RESIDENT.  aLSO, THE "eDDIE
  LIVES..."
MESSAGE WAS ADDED (CAN YOU GUESS WHY EXACTLY "eDDIE"?)

version 1.31, 3-jan-1989


tHIS BECAME THE MOST COMMON VERSION OF eDDIE. a CODE WAS ADDED TO

FIND THE int 13 ROM-VECTOR ON MANY POPULAR xt'S AND at'S.  aLSO,

OTHER MESSAGES WERE ADDED SO ITS LENGTH WOULD BE EXACTLY 1800 BYTES.

tHERE WAS A SUBSEQUENT, 1.32 VERSION (19-jan-1989), WHICH ADDED

SELF-CHECKSUM AND OTHER INTERESTING FEATURES THAT WAS ABANDONED

BECAUSE IT WAS EXTREMELY BUGGY.


iN EARLY mARCH 1989 VERSION 1.31 WAS CALLED INTO EXISTENCE AND

STARTED TO LIVE ITS OWN LIFE TO ALL ENGINEERS' AND OTHER SUCKERS'

TERROR.  aND, THE LAST


version 1.4, 17-oct-1989


tHIS WAS A BUGFIX FOR VERSION 1.31, AND ADDED SOME INTERESTING NEW

FEATURES.  sUPPORT HAS BEEN ADDED FOR dos 2.X AND dos 4.X.  fOR

pOST nOTE:


tHERE IS A RUMOR CONCERNING THE FACT THAT rabid NOW HAS

THE dARK aVENGER ON THEIR STAFF OF VIRUS WRITERS, AND THAT

THE NEW dARK aVENGER VARIANT RELEASED BY THEM WAS, IN FACT,

WRITTEN BY HIM.  tHIS HAS YET TO BE PROVEN.


tHE MORE ACCEPTABLE BELIEF CONCERNING THIS NEW STRAIN

IS THAT rabid SIMPLY PICKED UP THE SOURCE CODE FOR dARK aVENGER,

RELEASED LAST dECEMBER, AND MODIFIED IT.

vESSELIN bONTCHEV REPORTS IN mAY 1990:


tHE dARK aVENGER VIRUS.

======================


- i FOUND TWO NEW MUTATIONS OF THIS VIRUS. wELL, MAYBE

"MUTATIONS" IS NOT THE CORRECT WORD. iN THE FIRST OF THEM, THE

FIRST 16 CHARACTERS OF THE STRING "eDDIE LIVES...  SOMEWHERE IN

TIME!" WERE REPLACED WITH BLANKS.


iN THE SECOND EXAMPLE, ALL STRINGS (THE MESSAGE ABOVE, THE

COPYRIGHT MESSAGE AND THE "dIANA p."  STRING) WERE REPLACED WITH

BLANKS.  - tHE AUTHOR OF THE dARK aVENGER VIRUS (tHE BASTARD!  i

STILL CANNOT DETERMINE WHO HE IS.) HAS RELEASED THE SOURCE CODE

OF HIS VIRUS.


iT IS FULL WITH IRONIC COMMENTS ABOUT ME.  oF COURSE, NOW WE HAVE

TO EXPECT LOTS OF NEW,SIMILAR VIRUSES TO APPEAR.  aT LEAST, THIS

LEADED TO ONE GOOD THING - THE SOURCE HELPED ME VERY MUCH IN

DISASSEMBLING THE v2000 VIRUS.  - i RECEIVED A RATHER OFFENSIVE

ANONYMOUS LETTER FROM THIS PERSON.  iN IT HE CLAIMS TO BE ALSO

THE AUTHOR OF BOTH THE v2000 (i TRUST THIS) AND THE nUMBER OF THE

bEAST VIRUSES (THE LATTER IS UNLIKELY).  [sEE aBOVE]

tHIS VIRUS IS ALSO "MADE IN bULGARIA" AND AGAIN i AM INDIRECTLY THE

CAUSE OF ITS CREATION.  i AM A WELL KNOWN "VIRUS-BUSTER" IN bULGARIA

AND MY ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS ARE VERY WIDELY USED.  oF COURSE, VIRUS

DESIGNERS DIDN'T LIKE IT.  sO THEIR NEXT CREATION...  CAUSES TROUBLE

TO MY ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS.


tHIS VIRUS IS EXACTLY 2000 BYTES LONG AND i THINK THAT IT WAS

CREATED BY THE AUTHOR OF THE eDDIE (dARK aVENGER) VIRUS.  tHE

PROGRAMMING STYLE IS THE SAME AND THERE ARE EVEN PIECES OF CODE

WHICH ARE THE SAME.


tHE VIRUS ACTS MUCH LIKE THE eDDIE ONE --- IT INSTALLS RESIDENT IN

MEMORY BY MANIPULATING THE MEMORY CONTROL BLOCKS; INFECTS

command.com AT THE FIRST RUN; INFECTS BOTH .com- AND .exe-FILES;

INFECTS FILES WHEN ONE EXECUTES THEM AS WELL AS WHEN ONE COPIES THEM.


hOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME EXTRAS ADDED.  fIRST, THE VIRUS IS ABLE TO

FETCH THE ORIGINAL int 13H VECTOR JUST LIKE THE v512 ONE (BY USING

THE SAME UNDOCUMENTED FUNCTION --- TRICKS SPREAD FAST BETWEEN VIRUS

PROGRAMMERS).


sECOND, IT INTERCEPTS THE FIND-FIRST (fcb) AND FIND-NEXT (fcb)

        FUNCTIONS --- JUST LIKE v651 (AKA eddie ii) (AND CONTAINS THE SAME

        BUGS), SO YOU WON'T SEE THE INCREASED FILE LENGTHS IN THE LISTING

        DISPLAYED BY THE dir COMMAND.


tHIRD, IT CONTAINS THE STRING "cOPYRIGHT (c) 1989 BY vESSELIN

       bONTCHEV", SO PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT i AM THE AUTHOR OF THIS VIRUS.

       iN FACT, THE VIRUS SEARCHES EVERY PROGRAM BEING EXECUTED FOR THIS

       STRING (THE CASE OF THE LETTERS DOES NOT MATTER) AND IF FOUND,

       HANGS THE SYSTEM.  iT IS NOT NECESSARY TO TELL YOU THAT ALL MY

       ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS CONTAIN THIS STRING.  oF COURSE, NOW i WILL HAVE

       TO USE SOME KIND OF ENCRYPTION, JUST TO PREVENT SUCH TRICKS.


       vESSELIN bONTCHEV REPORTED IN mAY 1990:


       tHE v2000 VIRUS (dark avenger 2000)

       ===================================


       - iT TURNED OUT THAT THE EXAMPLE OF THIS VIRUS i SENT TO SOME OF

       THE ANTIVIRUS RESEARCHERS WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION.  tHE

       ORIGINAL CONTAINS THE STRING "oNLY THE gOOD DIE YOUNG..."

       INSTEAD OF THE "cOPY ME - i WANT TO TRAVEL" MESSAGE.  aLSO A

       SMALL PIECE OF CODE IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION WAS PATCHED TO

       CONTAIN THE "666" STRING. (tHAT IS, THE VERSION YOU HAVE CONTAINS

       THIS STRING, THE ORIGINAL DOES NOT.)


       - tHERE EXISTS ALSO A SMALL MUTATION OF THE VERSION YOU HAVE.

       tHE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE c' CHARACTER IN THE WORD "cOPY"

       WAS CHANGED TO z'.

-
       wHEN DESCRIBING THE v2000 VIRUS, i STATED THAT IT HALTS THE

       COMPUTER IF YOU RUN A PROGRAM WHICH CONTAINS THE STRING

       "cOPYRIGHT (C)1989 BY vESSELIN bONTCHEV". tHIS IS NOT QUITE

       CORRECT. iN FACT, THE PROGRAMS ARE ONLY CHECKED FOR THE "vESSELIN

       bONTCHEV" PART OF THE STRING.


       - i OBTAINED jOHN mCaFEE'S PROGRAM cLEAN, VERSION 60.  iN THE

       ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION HE STATES ABOUT THE v2000 VIRUS THAT

       "tHE VIRUS IS VERY VIRULENT AND HAS CAUSED SYSTEM CRASHES AND

       LOST DATA, AS WELL AS CAUSING SOME SYSTEMS TO BECOME NON-BOOTABLE

       AFTER INFECTION".  tHIS IS NOT VERY CORRECT, OR AT LEAST, THERE

       IS MUCH MORE TO BE SAID.  tHE VIRUS IS EXACTLY AS VIRULENT AS THE

       dARK aVENGER VIRUS, AND FOR THE SAME REASON.  iT INFECTS FILES

       NOT ONLY WHEN ONE EXECUTES THEM, BUT ALSO WHEN ONE READS OR

       COPIES THEM. tHIS IS ACHIEVED EXACTLY IN THE SAME MANNER AS IN

       THE dARK aVENGER.  tHE SYSTEMS BECOME NON-BOOTABLE WHEN THE VIRUS

       INFECTS THE TWO HIDDEN FILES OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM - IT CANNOT

       DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE REGULAR .com FILES.  bY THE WAY, THE

       dARK aVENGER VIRUS OFTEN CAUSES THE SAME EFFECT.  aND AT LAST,

       BUT NOT LEAST (:-)), THE VIRUS IS HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE - JUST AS

       THE dARK aVENGER IS.  iT DESTROYS THE INFORMATION ON A RANDOMLY

       SELECTED SECTOR ON THE DISK ONCE IN EVERY 16 RUNS OF AN INFECTED

       PROGRAM. tHE RANDOM FUNCTION IS EXACTLY THE SAME, AND THE

       COUNTERS (0 TO 15 AND FOR THE LAST ATTACKED SECTOR) ARE EXACTLY

       THE SAME AND ON THE SAME OFFSETS IN THE BOOT SECTOR AS WITH THE

       dARK aVENGER VIRUS.  tHE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE DESTROYED

       SECTOR IS OVERWRITTEN NOT WITH A PART OF THE VIRUS BODY, BUT WITH

       THE BOOT SECTOR INSTEAD.  tHIS MAKES A BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO

       DISCOVER WHICH FILES ARE DESTROYED - THE BOOT SECTOR IS CONTAINED

       IN MANY "GOOD" PROGRAMS, SUCH AS format, sys, ndd.  aLSO, THE

       NASTIEST THING - THE DAMAGE FUNCTION IS NOT PERFORMED VIA int 26H

       (WHICH CAN BE INTERCEPTED).  tHE VIRUS DETERMINES THE ADDRESS OF

       THE DEVICE DRIVER FOR THE RESPECTIVE DISK UNIT (USING AN

       UNDOCUMENTED dos FUNCTION CALL, OF COURSE.  i BEGIN TO WONDER IF

       rALF bROWN DID ANY GOOD WHEN HE MADE THE INFORMATION IN THE

       interXYY FILE AVAILABLE :-)).  tHEN IT PERFORMS A DIRECT CALL TO

       THAT ADDRESS.  tHE DEVICE DRIVER IN dos DOES ITS WORK AND ISSUES

       THE APPROPRIATE int 13H.  hOWEVER THE VIRUS HAS SCANNED THE

       CONTROLLERS' rom SPACE AND HAS DETERMINED THE ORIGINAL ADDRESS OF

       THE INTERRUPT HANDLER - JUST AS THE dARK aVENGER VIRUS DOES.

       tHEN IT HAS TEMPORARY REPLACED THE int 13H VECTOR WITH THE

       A

       CANNOT BE INTERCEPTED.


       - aLSO THIS VIRUS (UNLIKE dARK aVENGER) SUPPORTS pc-dos VERSION

       4.0 AND WILL WORK (AND INFECT) UNDER IT.

       
- tHE BYTES 84 a8 a0 ad a0 20 8f 2e IN THE VIRUS BODY ARE THE

       NAME "dIANA p.", THIS TIME WRITTEN IN CYRILLICS.

   gENERAL cOMMENTS:
   tHE wHALE vIRUS WAS SUBMITTED IN EARLY sEPTEMBER, 1990. tHIS VIRUS

   HAD BEEN RUMORED TO EXIST SINCE THE ISOLATION OF THE fISH 6 vIRUS IN

   jUNE, 1990.  iT HAS BEEN REFERRED TO BY SEVERAL NAMES BESIDES wHALE,

   INCLUDING mOTHER fISH AND z tHE wHALE.  tHE ORIGIN OF THIS VIRUS IS

   SUBJECT TO SOME SPECULATION, THOUGH IT IS PROBABLY FROM hAMBURG,

   wEST gERMANY DUE TO A REFERENCE WITHIN THE VIRAL CODE ONCE IT IS DECRYPTED.


   tHE FIRST TIME A PROGRAM INFECTED WITH THE wHALE vIRUS IS EXECUTED,

   THE wHALE WILL INSTALL ITSELF MEMORY RESIDENT IN HIGH SYSTEM MEMORY

   BUT BELOW THE 640k dos BOUNDARY.  oN THE AUTHOR'S xt CLONE, THE

   VIRUS ALWAYS STARTS AT ADDRESS 9d90.  aVAILABLE FREE MEMORY WILL

   BE DECREASED BY 9,984 BYTES.  mOST UTILITIES WHICH DISPLAY MEMORY

   USAGE WILL ALSO INDICATE A VALUE FOR TOTAL SYSTEM MEMORY WHICH IS

   9,984 BYTES LESS THAN WHAT IS ACTUALLY INSTALLED.


   tHE FOLLOWING TEXT STRING CAN BE FOUND IN MEMORY ON SYSTEMS

   INFECTED WITH THE wHALE VIRUS:  "z the whale".


   iMMEDIATELY UPON BECOMING MEMORY RESIDENT, THE SYSTEM USER WILL

   EXPERIENCE THE SYSTEM SLOWING DOWN.  nOTICEABLE EFFECTS OF THE

   SYSTEM SLOWDOWN INCLUDE VIDEO FLICKER TO EXTREMELY SLOW SCREEN

   WRITES.  sOME PROGRAMS MAY APPEAR TO "HANG", THOUGH THEY WILL

   EVENTUALLY EXECUTE PROPERLY IN MOST CASES SINCE THE "HANG" IS DUE

   TO THE SLOWING OF THE SYSTEM.


   wHEN A PROGRAM IS EXECUTED WITH THE wHALE MEMORY RESIDENT, THE VIRUS

   WILL INFECT THE PROGRAM.  iNFECTED PROGRAMS INCREASE IN LENGTH, THE

   ACTUAL CHANGE IN LENGTH IS USUALLY 9,216 BYTES.  nOTE THE "USUALLY":

   THIS VIRUS DOES OCCASIONALLY INFECT A PROGRAM WITH A "MUTANT" WHICH

   WILL BE A DIFFERENT LENGTH.  iF THE FILE LENGTH INCREASE IS EXACTLY

   9,216 BYTES, THE wHALE WILL HIDE THE CHANGE IN FILE LENGTH WHEN A

   DISK DIRECTORY COMMAND IS EXECUTED.  iF THE FILE LENGTH OF THE VIRAL

   CODE ADDED TO THE PROGRAM IS OTHER THAN 9,216 BYTES, THE FILE LENGTH

   DISPLAYED WITH THE DIRECTORY COMMAND WILL EITHER THE ACTUAL INFECTED

   FILE LENGTH, OR THE ACTUAL INFECTED FILE LENGTH MINUS 9,216 BYTES.


   eXECUTING THE dos chkdsk PROGRAM ON INFECTED SYSTEMS WILL RESULT IN

   FILE ALLOCATION ERRORS BEING REPORTED.  iF chkdsk /f IS EXECUTED,

   FILE DAMAGE WILL RESULT.


   tHE wHALE ALSO ALTERS THE PROGRAM'S DATE/TIME IN THE DIRECTORY WHEN

   THE FILE IS EXECUTED, THOUGH IT IS NOT SET TO THE SYSTEM DATE/TIME

   OF INFECTION.  oCCASIONALLY, wHALE WILL ALTER THE DIRECTORY ENTRY

   FOR THE PROGRAM IT IS INFECTING IMPROPERLY, RESULTING IN THE DIRECTORY

   ENTRY BECOMING INVALID.  tHESE PROGRAMS WITH INVALID DIRECTORY

   ENTRIES WILL APPEAR WHEN THE DIRECTORY IS LISTED, BUT SOME DISK

   UTILITIES WILL NOT ALLOW ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM.  iN THESE CASES, THE

   DIRECTORY ENTRY CAN BE FIXED WITH nORTON uTILITIES fd COMMAND TO

   RESET THE FILE DATE.


   THE wHALE OCCASIONALLY WILL CHANGE ITS BEHAVIOR WHILE IT IS MEMORY

   RESIDENT.  wHILE MOST OF THE TIME IT ONLY INFECTS FILES WHEN

   EXECUTED, THERE ARE PERIODS OF TIME WHEN IT WILL INFECT ANY FILE

   OPENED FOR ANY REASON.  iT WILL ALSO, AT TIMES, DISINFECT FILES

   WHEN THEY ARE COPIED WITH THE dos COPY COMMAND, AT OTHER TIMES IT

   WILL NOT "DISINFECT ON THE FLY".


   oCCASIONALLY, THE wHALE vIRUS WILL SIMULATE WHAT APPEARS TO BE A

   SYSTEM REBOOT.  wHILE THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS OCCUR, WHEN IT DOES OCCUR

   THE bREAK KEY IS DISABLED SO THAT THE USER CANNOT EXIT UNEXPECTEDLY

   FROM THE EXECUTION OF THE SYSTEM'S aUTOeXEC.bAT FILE.  iF THE

   aUTOeXEC.bAT FILE CONTAINED ANY SOFTWARE WHICH DOES FILE OPENS UP

   OTHER EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS, THOSE OPENED EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS WILL

   BE INFECTED AT THAT TIME IF THEY WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INFECTED.

   tYPICALLY, FILES INFECTED IN THIS MANNER WILL INCREASE BY 9,216

   BYTES THOUGH IT WILL NOT BE SHOWN IN A DIRECTORY LISTING.


   a HIDDEN FILE MAY BE FOUND IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF DRIVE c: ON

   INFECTED FILES.  tHIS FILE IS NOT ALWAYS PRESENT, THE VIRUS WILL

   SOMETIMES REMOVE IT, ONLY TO RECREATE IT AGAIN AT A LATER TIME.

   tHE NAME OF THIS HIDDEN FILE IS fish-#9.tbl, IT CONTAINS AN

   IMAGE OF THE HARD DISK'S PARTITION TABLE ALONG WITH THE FOLLOWING

   MESSAGE: "fISH vIRUS #9  a wHALE IS NO fISH!  mIND HER mUTANT fISH
             AND THE HIDDEN fISH eGGS  FOR THEY ARE DAMAGING.
             tHE SIXTH fISH MUTATES ONLY IF THE wHALE IS IN  HER cAVE."
     aFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THIS HIDDEN FILE, THE AUTHOR OF THIS

     DOCUMENT MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPT TO HAVE THE fISH 6 vIRUS MUTATE

     BY INTRODUCING IT AND wHALE INTO A SYSTEM.  uNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES

     DID A MUTATION OF EITHER VIRUS RESULT, THE RESULTANT FILES WERE

     INFECTED WITH BOTH AN IDENTIFIABLE fISH 6 INFECTION AND A wHALE

     INFECTION.


     wHALE IS HOSTILE TO DEBUGGERS AND CONTAINS MANY TRAPS TO PREVENT

     SUCCESSFUL DECRYPTION OF THE VIRUS.  oNE OF ITS "TRAPS" IS TO LOCK

     OUT THE KEYBOARD IF IT DETERMINES A DEBUGGER IS IN USE.

 

     hERE'S A SIDE NOTE BY THE AUTHOR OF f-pROT



   wHALE tHIS IS A RECENT, RATHER REMARKABLE VIRUS.  iT IS LONG, 9216 BYTES AND

   ABLE TO INFECT com AND exe FILES.  tHE INCREASE IN FILE SIZE IS NOT

   VISIBLE THOUGH, WHILE THE VIRUS IS ACTIVE IN MEMORY, AS IT USES SEVERAL

   ADVANCED "STEALTH" METHODS.  oTHER EFFECTS OF THE VIRUS ARE NOT KNOWN,

   BUT ONE INFECTED PROGRAM DISPLAYED THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WHEN RUN:


                the whale in search of the 8 fish

                i am 'KNZYVO│' in hamburg ADDR ERROR d9eb,02


    mOST OF THE VIRUS IS DEVOTED TO ENCRYPTION AND CODE WHICH MOVES BLOCKS OF

    VIRUS CODE AROUND.  tHIS OVERHEAD RESULTS IN A CONSIDERABLE SLOWDOWN OF

    INFECTED SYSTEMS.



    aND HERE IT IS.  uSE YOUR EDITOR TO COPY THE BELOW MACHINE LANGUAGE

    SCRIPT TO A FILE CALLED whale.scr  nEXT USE debug TO MAKE IT INTO A

    com FILE.  uSE THE COMMAND  debug < whale.scr   wHEN IT GETS DONE

    YOU'LL SEE A FILE CALLED whale.com.  tHERE IT IS, HAVE FUN - AND

    MAKE SOME LOSERS DAY!

      nOW A WORD FROM A REAL DICK



      wHEN sss TOLD ME HOW MUCH OF A DICK THIS GUY i'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU

      ABOUT IS i DIDN'T BELIVE HIM.  hIS NAME WILL BE KEPT, BECAUSE IF WE

      MENTION IT HE'LL GET ALL SOUPED AND THINK HE'S PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER

      ONE IN THE VIRUS COMMUNITY.


      wHO HE IS, IS THE AUTHOR OF A VERY SAD ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAM AND VIRUS

      SCANNER CALLED flu-shot AND vir-x, RESPECTIVLY.  wHAT THE MAN IS,

      IS A SAD CASE WHO WALLOWS IN THE SHADOW OF jOHN mCaFFE AND CURSES

      TO HIS BITTER SELF WHY HE IS NOT A POPULAR ANTI-VIRUS AUTHOR.  tHE

      REASON IS SIMPLE.  hIS PRODUCT SUCKS.  wELL LETS PUT IT THIS WAY,

      HIS SELF PROCLAIMED 'GREAT' SCANNER FAILS TO DETECT OVER 60% OF ALL

      VIRUSES OUT THERE.  oN TOP OF THAT, IT WAS VERY SINPLE FOR A

      PERSON, WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS, TO INFECT HIS VIRUS SCANNER, AND

      SEND OUT TROJAN COPIES ALL OVER THE usa.tHE PRODUCT, flu-shot, IS

      THE MOST ANNOYING, FALSE-ALARM CAUSING, PIECE OF TRASH ON THE MARKET.
      nUFF SAID ON THE SUBJECT.



      wHAT MAKES US TO PISSED AT SAID ASSHOLE?  wELL, TAKE INTO MIND THE

      FOLLOWING, FROM THE DOCUMENTATION OF flu-shot.
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       tHE cHALLENGE TO THE wORM

       =========================
       wHEN i FIRST RELEASED A PROGRAM TO TRY TO THWART THEIR DEMENTED 

       LITTLE EFFORTS,i PUBLISHED THIS LETTER IN THE ARCHIVE (STILL IN 

       THE flu_shot+ ARCHIVE OF WHICH THIS IS A PART OF).  wHAT i SAY IN 

       IT STILL HOLDS:


       aS FOR THE DESIGNER OF THE VIRUS PROGRAM: MOST 

       LIKELY AN IMPOTENT ADOLESCENT, INCAPABLE OF 

       NORMAL SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND ATTEMPTING TO 

       PROVE THEIR OWN WORTH TO THEMSELVES THROUGH 

       THESE TYPE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.


       nEVER SUCCEEDING IN THAT TASK (OR IN ANY 

       OTHER), SINCE THEY HAVE NO WORTH, THEY WILL ONE 

       DAY TAKE A LOOK AT THEMSELVES AND WHAT THEY'VE 

       DONE IN THEIR PAST, AND KILL THEMSELVES IN 

       DISGUST.  tHIS IS A gOOD tHING, SINCE IT SAVES 

       THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY WHICH NORMALLY WOULD BE 

       WASTED ON THERAPY AND TREATMENT OF THIS MISCREANT.
       iF THEY *REALLY* WANT A CHALLENGE, THEY'LL TRY 

       TO DESTROY *MY* HARD DISK ON MY bbs, INSTEAD OF 

       THE DISK OF SOME INNOCENT PERSON.  i CHALLENGE 

       THEM TO UPLOAD A VIRUS OR OTHER tROJAN HORSE TO 

       MY bbs THAT i CAN'T DISARM.  iT IS DOUBTFUL THE 

       CHALLENGE WILL BE TAKEN: THE PROFILE OF SUCH A 

       PERSON PROHIBITS THEM FROM ATTACKING THOSE WHO 

       CAN FIGHT BACK.  aLAS, HAVING A GO WITH THIS  

       LOWLIFE WOULD BE AMUSING FOR THE FIVE MINUTES 

       IT TAKES TO DISARM WHATEVER THEY INVENT.


       gO AHEAD, YOU GOOD-FOR-NOTHING LITTLE 

       SLIMEBUCKET:  MAKE *MY* DAY!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


fUNNY ISEN'T IT?  wELL mR. dICKBURG, i AM NOT AN ADOLESENT, NOR AM

i IMPOTENT.  i LEAD QUITE A HEALTY SOCIAL LIFE, AND HAVE NO SUCIDAL

URGES.  wHAT i AM IS A PERSON WHO (MABEY BECAUSE OF SOME DEEP DOWN

PSYCOLOGICAL DISORDER) FINDS JOY IN SEEING SOME GEEKED OUT,

COMPUTER NERDS SYSTEM GO DOWN THE DRAIN IN A FLASH.


oH YES THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE ME OUT THERE, MANY OTHERS.  iT (VIRUS

WRITING) IS A JOKE.  iT IS DONE FOR A GOOD LAUGH, TO SEE DICKHEADS

LIKE YOU LOSE TIME AND MONEY.  sO MY FRIEND, AT THIS TIME i START

AN ACTIVE CAMPAIN AFTER YOU ASS.


aNYONE OUT THERE WHO WANTS TO MAKE SOME DICKS DAY, CALL THIS

ASSHOLES CHEAP bbs AND LETS TAKE HIM DOWN.   tHE NUMBER IS

(212)-889-6438.   tROJANS, aNSI-bOMBS, AND ALL vIRUSES ARE ACEPTED.

gO TO IT!

tHE oNTARIO vIRUS




hERE A QUICK NICE LITTLE VIRUS FROM OUR BOYZ UP NORTH.
sTATUS:    rARE

dISCOVERED:  jULY, 1990

sYMPTOMS:    .com & .exe GROWTH; DECREASE IN SYSTEM AND FREE MEMORY;

              HARD DISK ERRORS IN THE CASE OF EXTREME INFECTIONS

oRIGIN:      oNTARIO, cANADA

eFF lENGTH:  512 bYTES

tYPE cODE:   prTak - pARASITIC eNCRYPTED rESIDENT .com & .exe iNFECTOR

dETECTION mETHOD:  vIRUsCAN v66+, pRO-sCAN 2.01+, nav

rEMOVAL iNSTRUCTIONS:  scan /d, OR dELETE INFECTED FILES

gENERAL cOMMENTS:

tHE oNTARIO vIRUS WAS ISOLATED BY mIKE sHIELDS IN oNTARIO, cANADA

IN jULY, 1990.  tHE oNTARIO VIRUS IS A MEMORY RESIDENT INFECTOR OF

.com, .exe, AND OVERLAY FILES.  iT WILL INFECT command.com.


tHE FIRST TIME A PROGRAM INFECTED WITH THE oNTARIO vIRUS IS EXECUTED,

IT WILL INSTALL ITSELF MEMORY RESIDENT ABOVE THE TOP OF SYSTEM MEMORY

BUT BELOW THE 640k dos BOUNDARY.  tOTAL SYSTEM MEMORY AND FREE MEMORY

WILL BE DECREASED BY 2,048 BYTES.  aT THIS TIME, THE VIRUS WIL

INFECT command.com ON THE c: DRIVE, INCREASING ITS LENGTH BY 512 BYTES.


eACH TIME AN UNINFECTED PROGRAM IS EXECUTED ON THE SYSTEM WITH THE

VIRUS MEMORY RESIDENT, THE PROGRAM WILL BECOME INFECTED WITH THE VIRAL

CODE LOCATED AT THE END OF THE FILE.  fOR .com FILES, THEY WILL

INCREASE BY 512 BYTES IN ALL CASES.  fOR .exe AND OVERLAY FILES, THE

FILE LENGTH INCREASE WILL BE 512 - 1023 BYTES.  tHE DIFFERENCE IN

LENGTH FOR .exe AND OVERLAY FILES IS BECAUSE THE VIRUS WILL FILL OUT

THE UNUSED SPACE AT THE END OF THE LAST SECTOR OF THE UNINFECTED FILE

WITH RANDOM DATA (USUALLY A PORTION OF THE DIRECTORY) AND THEN APPEND

ITSELF TO THE END OF THE FILE AT THE NEXT SECTOR.  sYSTEMS USING

A SECTOR SIZE OF MORE THAN 512 BYTES MAY NOTICE LARGER FILE INCREASES

FOR INFECTED FILES.  iNFECTED FILES WILL ALWAYS HAVE A FILE LENGTH

THAT IS A MULTIPLE OF THE SECTOR SIZE ON THE DISK.


iN THE CASE OF EXTREME INFECTIONS OF THE oNTARIO vIRUS, HARD DISK

ERRORS MAY BE NOTICED.


oNTARIO USES A COMPLEX ENCRYPTION ROUTINE, AND A SIMPLE IDENTIFICATION

STRING WILL NOT IDENTIFY THIS VIRUS.

 gENERAL cOMMENTS:
 tHE 1260 VIRUS WAS FIRST ISOLATED IN jANUARY, 1990.  tHIS

         VIRUS DOES NOT INSTALL ITSELF RESIDENT IN MEMORY, BUT IS IT

         EXTREMELY VIRULENT AT INFECTING .com FILES.  iNFECTED FILES

         WILL HAVE THEIR LENGTH INCREASED BY 1,260 BYTES, AND THE

         RESULTING FILE WILL BE ENCRYPTED.  tHE ENCRYPTION KEY CHANGES

         WITH EACH INFECTION WHICH OCCURS.


         tHE 1260 VIRUS IS DERIVED FROM THE ORIGINAL vIENNA vIRUS, THOUGH

         IT IS HIGHLY MODIFIED.


         tHIS VIRUS WAS DEVELOPED AS A RESEARCH VIRUS BY mARK wASHBURN, WHO

         WISHED TO SHOW THE ANTI-VIRAL COMMUNITY WHY IDENTIFICATION STRING

         SCANNERS DO NOT WORK IN ALL CASES.  tHE ENCRYPTION USED IN 1260 IS

         ONE OF MANY POSSIBLE CASES OF THE ENCRYPTION WHICH MAY OCCUR WITH

         wASHBURN'S LATER RESEARCH VIRUS, v2p2.
