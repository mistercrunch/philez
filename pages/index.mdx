## What is NPC?

**Northern Phun Co.** was a bilingual (French/English) underground e-zine published from Quebec City, Canada between November 1992 and April 1994. The "418" in the scene name refers to Quebec City's area code.

NPC was part of the early 90s hacker/phreaker zine culture, covering topics like:

- Phreaking (telephone system exploration)
- Hacking VAX/VMS and Unix systems
- BBS culture and the underground scene
- Social engineering and trashing
- Early internet exploration

## The Archive

## Historical Context

NPC emerged during a fascinating period in computing history—before the World Wide Web became mainstream, when BBSes (Bulletin Board Systems) were the primary means of online community, and when the underground scene communicated through text files distributed on floppy disks and dial-up connections.

The zine proudly published in both French and English, making it one of the few bilingual publications in the scene. As the editors wrote in their first issue:

> *"On va faire mieux, on va innover, on va diffuser nos ragots et nos histoires à dormir debout DANS LES DEUX LANGUES!"*
>
> *("We're going to do better, we're going to innovate, we're going to spread our gossip and tall tales IN BOTH LANGUAGES!")*
